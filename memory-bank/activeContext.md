# Active Context

## Current Focus: Implementing AI Chat Integration

Our immediate focus is on implementing AI chat capabilities into the app, allowing users to interact with AI language models to enhance their writing experience. This follows the redesign of the core UI to a Scrivener-like three-panel layout, which has been completed.

## AI Chat Integration Design

### Key Components Implemented
- **Secure API Key Management** - Created a system to store API keys securely in the Keychain
- **ChatMessage and ChatConversation Models** - Developed SwiftData models for persistent chat history
- **APIKeySetupView** - Built an interface for users to enter and validate API keys
- **AISettingsView** - Created settings panel for configuring AI providers and features
- **ChatView** - Implemented the main chat interface with message bubbles and document context integration

### AI Provider Support
- Added support for multiple AI providers (currently Claude and OpenAI)
- Created a provider-agnostic interface that can be extended to other LLMs
- Implemented secure API key validation and storage
- Built UI for managing API keys and selecting default providers

### Document Context Integration
- Chat system is aware of the current document context
- Built features to incorporate document content into prompts
- Added specialized tools for document summarization and style analysis
- Created conversation persistence linked to specific documents

### Security Considerations
- API keys are stored securely in the system Keychain
- Keys never appear in application logs or storage
- All API key validation is done with secure connections

## Recent Changes

### SwiftData Models for Chat
- Created ChatMessage model with role, content, and timestamp
- Implemented ChatConversation model for organizing messages
- Added relationships between messages and conversations
- Set up cascading deletion to maintain database integrity
- Added document context references to enable document-aware conversations

### API Key Management
- Implemented APIKeyManager for secure API key storage
- Created Keychain integration for sensitive credential storage
- Added validation methods for API key format checking
- Built UI components for API key input and management

### Settings Integration
- Updated app settings model to include AI provider preferences
- Enhanced settings UI with dedicated AI configuration panel
- Added toggles for enabling/disabling AI features
- Created provider selection interface with availability indicators

### Chat Interface
- Designed and implemented ChatView with message bubbles
- Created conversation management with persistent history
- Built context-aware document integration features
- Implemented simulated responses for prototype testing
- Added conversation clearing and management functions

## Technical Considerations
- Maintained secure practices for API key storage using Keychain
- Designed models to support future offline/online switching
- Created extensible provider system for future AI model support
- Made conversation storage efficient with SwiftData relationships
- Added proper error handling for network failures and API issues

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: API Integration
- Complete the provider-specific API clients
- Implement proper message streaming for realistic chat experience
- Add token counting and management for API quotas
- Create proper error handling for API failures

### Priority 2: Enhanced Context Management
- Improve document context awareness with semantic chunking
- Add support for project-level context (multiple documents)
- Implement conversation memory management for long chats
- Create context retention across chat sessions

### Priority 3: Advanced Chat Features
- Add support for generating images and diagrams
- Implement code block formatting and syntax highlighting
- Create specialized writing improvement commands
- Build style and tone analysis capabilities

## Key Design Principles
- Maintain familiar interface for Scrivener users while modernizing the experience
- Focus on performance with large complex documents and projects
- Ensure all advanced formatting translates correctly to export formats
- Design AI features to enhance rather than distract from the writing process
- Create a scalable architecture that can grow with future feature additions

## Current Focus

### âœ… Project Restructuring and Renaming (COMPLETED - SOURCE FILES)

The project restructuring and renaming process has been successfully completed for source files:

1. Created scripts to identify duplicate files between root and writing_app directories
2. Analyzed differences between duplicate files to determine which versions to keep
3. Consolidated all necessary files into a new OpenPage directory structure
4. Created and verified proper file structure for new OpenPage project
5. Executed cleanup script to remove original files with a backup created (backup_20250406_143818)

The restructuring provides several benefits:
- Clean separation between legacy code and new project structure
- Consistent naming across all files and resources
- Eliminated duplicate code and resolved conflicting versions
- Proper organization following Swift best practices

### âœ… Dark Mode Support Improvements (COMPLETED)

We've fixed inconsistent behavior with the system theme by implementing proper dark mode support throughout the application. Previously, when the system theme changed from light to dark, only some UI parts adapted properly while others (especially the inspector and chat views) remained in light mode, causing legibility issues like white text on white backgrounds.

#### Improvements Made:
1. **Direct Color Adaptations**
   - Used built-in SwiftUI color schemes that automatically adapt to dark mode
   - Implemented explicit dark/light color handling in all views
   - Added `.colorScheme` environment variables to detect system theme

2. **Inspector View Fixes**
   - Updated `SimplestInspectorView` to use dynamic background colors
   - Added explicit light/dark mode color handling for proper contrast

3. **Chat Interface Improvements**
   - Fixed message bubbles to properly adapt to dark mode
   - Enhanced contrast for better readability in dark mode

4. **System Integration**
   - Ensured the app respects the system color scheme preferences
   - Implemented proper dark mode transitions for all components

**Note:** We initially encountered build errors with our first approach using AppKit color references. We resolved this by simplifying our approach to use direct SwiftUI colors with dark mode conditionals instead of relying on system color names.

These changes ensure that the application has consistent appearance in both light and dark modes, improving usability and aesthetics.

### ðŸš¨ Project Restructuring - Pending Xcode Project Creation

After consolidating all source files, we need to create a new Xcode project to replace the old one:

1. Root Cause: The build is failing because it's looking for '/Users/deepanshukandpal/Documents/OpenPage/writing_app.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace' which was removed during cleanup
2. Solution: We need to create a new Xcode project named "OpenPage" to replace the old "writing_app" project

The following steps are required to complete the restructuring:

1. Create a new Xcode project with the correct settings
   - Product Name: OpenPage
   - Organization Identifier: deepskandpal
   - Interface: SwiftUI
   - Language: Swift
   - Include Tests: Yes

2. Configure the new Xcode project
   - Add existing files from the OpenPage directory
   - Set the proper bundle identifier (deepskandpal.OpenPage)
   - Import the OpenPage.entitlements file
   - Set deployment target to macOS 14.0+

3. Verify the application works correctly
   - Build and run the application
   - Test key functionality
   - Ensure SwiftData migration works properly

We've created several helper scripts to assist with this process:
- recover_project.sh - Creates the OpenPage.xcodeproj directory structure
- create_xcode_project.sh - Provides step-by-step instructions for creating the new Xcode project
- verify_openpage.sh - Checks the OpenPage directory structure and identifies missing files

### Next Steps

- Create new Xcode project following the steps in create_xcode_project.sh
- Build and test the application
- Continue refinement of the hierarchical document structure
- Design and implement advanced metadata UI for enhanced document properties
- Consider additional SwiftData optimizations for performance
- Explore additional AI integration features
