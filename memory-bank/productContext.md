# Product Context

## Purpose
Vibe Writing App aims to provide a comprehensive writing environment that combines the structured approach of professional tools like Scrivener with modern AI assistance and collaboration features. It addresses the need for sophisticated document organization, research integration, and planning tools while maintaining an elegant, intuitive interface.

## Problem Statement
Writers working on long-form content (novels, screenplays, academic papers, etc.) need tools that go beyond simple text editors. They require:
- Organization of complex, multi-part documents
- Integration of research materials alongside writing
- Planning tools for structure and narrative
- Flexible export options for different publication needs
- Assistance with writing process and collaboration

Professional tools like Scrivener provide powerful features but can have steep learning curves and lack modern AI assistance. Meanwhile, newer writing apps often focus on simplicity at the expense of power features needed by serious writers.

## Inspiration
The app is directly inspired by professional writing software like Scrivener, which offers:
- Hierarchical document organization with a binder system
- Research material integration
- Cork board planning with index cards
- Outliner views
- Customizable compilation/export

We aim to provide these powerful features while adding:
- A more modern, intuitive interface
- AI-powered writing assistance
- Real-time collaboration capabilities
- Cloud-based synchronization

## Target Users
- **Novelists**: Need to organize chapters and scenes, track characters and plot elements
- **Academics**: Need to organize research, citations, and structure complex arguments
- **Screenwriters**: Need specialized formatting and structural planning tools
- **Non-fiction writers**: Need research organization and structured outlines
- **Students**: Need to manage research and create well-structured long-form content

## Market Differentiation
While Scrivener is a market leader for serious writers, Vibe Writing App differentiates by:
- More intuitive interface with lower learning curve
- Integrated AI assistance through chat interface
- Modern design aesthetic with focus on typography
- Built-in collaboration features
- Native performance with SwiftUI and SwiftData
